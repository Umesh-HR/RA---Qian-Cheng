HyperSpectral Image (HSI) Segmentation:

The objective of this project is to analyze hyperspectral data using advanced models like the Vision Transformer (ViT). ViT utilizes the transformer architecture for image classification purposes, offering simplicity, excellent performance, and scalability. By segmenting hyperspectral images using such models, we can accurately assess crop health, identifying areas that are healthy, water-deficient, or lacking essential nutrients.â€‹

Hyperspectral imaging (HSI) is a powerful technique that captures detailed spectral information across numerous wavelengths, enabling the identification and differentiation of materials based on their chemical compositions. In agriculture, HSI serves as a unique signature to assess crop health by detecting specific spectral reflectance patterns associated with various plant conditions. For instance, changes in a plant's foliar chemistry due to stress or disease produce distinct spectral signatures, which can be detected through hyperspectral imaging.  

In summary, integrating hyperspectral imaging with state-of-the-art models like ViT enhances our ability to monitor and manage crop health effectively, leading to more informed agricultural practices and improved crop yields.
