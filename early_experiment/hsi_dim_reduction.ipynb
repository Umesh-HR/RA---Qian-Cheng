    "Yes, you can process three bands at a time from a multi-band hyperspectral image (HSI) and combine the results at the final layer. This approach is a common strategy in processing hyperspectral data, especially when trying to manage the high dimensionality and correlation between spectral bands. Hereâ€™s a general outline of how you might implement this:\n",
    "1.\tBand Selection:\n",
    "\tâ€¢\tSelect subsets of bands, such as three bands at a time, that you believe contain significant information for your analysis. The selection of bands can be sequential, random, or based on some spectral characteristics like bands covering specific wavelengths of interest.\n",
    "2.\tFeature Extraction:\n",
    "\tâ€¢\tProcess each triplet of bands separately through a neural network or another machine learning model to extract features. This can involve convolutional layers if you are using deep learning, which are adept at capturing spatial and spectral features.\n",
    "3.\tCombining Features:\n",
    "\tâ€¢\tAfter processing the individual triplets, the next step is to combine the extracted features. This can be done in several ways:\n",
    "\tâ€¢\tConcatenation: The features from each triplet are concatenated into a single feature vector.\n",
    "\tâ€¢\tFeature Fusion: Use more sophisticated methods like averaging, maximum, or learned fusion methods to combine features.\n",
    "4.\tFinal Layers:\n",
    "\tâ€¢\tPass the combined features through additional layers (if needed) to make final predictions or analyses. This could be classification layers, regression layers, or other custom layers depending on your application.\n",
    "5.\tTraining and Inference:\n",
    "\tâ€¢\tDuring training, ensure that the network learns to effectively integrate the features from different band triplets. It might be beneficial to include regularization techniques to prevent overfitting given the high-dimensional nature of HSI data.\n",
    "\tâ€¢\tInference would follow the trained modelâ€™s capability to generalize from the learned features of band triplets to unseen data."
